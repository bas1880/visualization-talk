Data Visualisation: Checklist
=============================


Data representation
-------------------

* Use of visual clues: Does the graph use strong and accurate visual
  clues such as positions and lengths?

  See [WongSeptember2010]_

* Salience: Are the important patterns in the presented data
  emphasised by use of salient visual features such as color, size,
  shape or an added mark? 

  See [WongOctober2010]_

* Symbol uniqueness: Are the same symbols always used in the same
  context and different symbols do not have overlapping meanings?

  See [WongMay2011]_

* Grouping by similarity, proximity and connection: Do related
  objects, such as data points and labels look alike, are connected by
  lines, placed close together or enclosed in a common space?

  See [WongNovember2010]_

Colors
------

* Use of colors: Are the colors necessary and can not be replaced by
  positional marks and/or lines?
  
  See [WongJuly2011]_

* Color coding: Are the colors used in the presentation discriminable
  (also for color-blind people and in black&white print) and do not
  introduce bias or unwanted artifacts?

  See  [WongAugust2010]_, [WongJune2011]_

 
Layout
------

* Grouping:  Is the grouping principle (see above) correctly applied to figure panels?

  See [WongNovember2010]_

* Arrangement: Are the figure/poster/slide elements aligned to
  (possibly implied) guides to emphasise the flow of arguments and
  express the figure's underlying meaning? 

  See [WongDecember2010]_

* Whitespace: Is the whitespace regular and used effectively as a
  means to attract readers' attention and make the non-white content
  stand out?

  See [WongJanuary2011]_

Typography
----------

* Typeface: Is the typeface used consistently and does not interfere with reading?

  See [WongApril2011]_
